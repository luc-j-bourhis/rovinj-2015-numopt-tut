Numerical optimisation
----------------------

The field of numerical optimisation is huge and has gone through several revolutions in the last two decades, making it nearly impossible to even introduce it in such a tutorial. Thus we will completely focus on crystallographic refinement. We will first briefly present the two main paradigms: least-squares and maximum likelihood. We will then explain constraints and restraints. The tutorial per se will then show how to implement constraints in least-squares refinement on a pedagogical example.

The participant should have a working knowledge of the cctbx, or they should have attended the other tutorial of mine introducing the cctbx.
